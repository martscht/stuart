\title{Compute the number of possible subtest combinations}
\usage{
combinations(data, factor.structure, items.per.subtest = NULL,
  number.of.subtests = 1, repeated.measures = NULL, mtmm = NULL, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data.frame containing all relevant data.}

\item{factor.structure}{A list linking factors to items. The names of the list elements correspond to the factor names. Each list element must contain a character-vector of item names that are indicators of this factor.}

\item{items.per.subtest}{A list containing the number of items per subtest. This must be in the same order as the \code{factor.structure} provided. If a single number, it is applied to all subtests. If \code{NULL} all items are evenly distributed among the subtests.}

\item{number.of.subtests}{A vector containing the number of subtests per construct. This must be in the same order as the \code{factor.structure} provided. If a single number, it is applied to all constructs. The default is to construct 1 subtest per construct.}

\item{repeated.measures}{A list linking factors that are repeated measures of each other. Repeated factors must be in one element of the list - other sets of factors in other elements of the list. When this is \code{NULL} (the default) a cross-sectional model is estimated.}

\item{mtmm}{A list linking factors that are measurements of the same construct with different methods. Measurements of the same construct must be in one element of the list - other sets of methods in other elements of the list. When this is \code{NULL} (the default) a single method model is estimated.}

\value{
Returns the number of possible subtest constellations.
}
\description{
Used to compute the number of possible subtest constellations prior to running either \code{\link{mmas}} or \code{\link{bruteforce}}.
